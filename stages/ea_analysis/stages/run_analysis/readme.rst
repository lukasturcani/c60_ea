Run Analysis
============

This stage creates a number of plots of the EA runs.
Only execute this stage after you have run
``prepare_output/create_image/create_image.bash``. If you have,
there is nothing to do here except run
``create_image/create_image.bash``. This will create a new image
called ``c60_ea_run_analysis``. The image will contain the directory
``/ea_analysis/run_analysis/output`` which has all the plots and
analysis produced by this stage.
