Prepare Output
==============

This stage is responsible for extracting the output of the EA and
turning it into a suitable format. In order to run this stage you
need to download ``ea_output.tar.gz``, extract it and place it into
``create_image``. Once you have done that, simply run
``create_image/create_image.bash`` to produce an image which contains
all the data prepared for analysis.
